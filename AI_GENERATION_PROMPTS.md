## 🎬 Lottie Animations - Creation Strategy

### Tools for Animations:

**Recommended Workflow:**

1. **Frame Generation:** Midjourney or DALL-E 3
   - Generate 5-8 keyframes per animation
   - Maintain consistency across frames
   - Same style as static SVGs

2. **Animation Creation:** Choose ONE:
   - **LottieFiles Creator** (Web-based, easiest) ✅ RECOMMENDED
     - Upload frames as image sequence
     - Set timing and easing
     - Export as Lottie JSON
     - https://lottiefiles.com/creator
   
   - **Adobe After Effects + Bodymovin** (Professional)
     - Import keyframes as layers
     - Animate in After Effects
     - Export with Bodymovin plugin to Lottie JSON
   
   - **Rive** (Alternative, easier than AE)
     - Import artwork
     - Create animations visually
     - Export as Lottie or Rive format

3. **Optimization:**
   - Use LottieFiles optimizer
   - Target <100KB per file
   - Test on mobile devices

**Animation Format:** `.json` files (Lottie JSON format)

## 💡 Pro Tips

**For Consistent Character:**
- Save your first good generation as reference
- Use same base prompt structure for all poses
- Mention "same character as before" if platform supports it
- Keep color values consistent

**For Better Quality:**
- Generate multiple variations, pick best
- Use upscaler for sharper images if needed
- Test on actual device screens
- Get feedback before finalizing all poses

**For Animations:**
- Start with high-priority animations first
- Test on low-end device for performance
- Use fewer frames if file size is too large
- Consider static SVG with Compose animation as fallback

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Nana Banana** is specifically designed for vector/SVG generation
- **LottieFiles Creator** is web-based, no software installation needed
- All animations should maintain the same character style as SVGs
- Consider cultural sensitivity in all depictions
- Test all assets on actual Android devices before finalizing

**Ready to Generate!** 🚀

Start with the 4 HIGH priority static poses and 2-3 HIGH priority animations. You can add more later based on user feedback and app needs.

**Estimated Time:**
- SVG Generation: 2-4 hours (12 poses)
- Animation Generation: 4-8 hours (keyframes + animation)
- Total: 1-2 days of generation work

Good luck with your AI generations! 🎨✨
